This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.0.

Simple web app demonstrating list/add/update/delete with Angular, Entity Framework Core and C#

Given more time I would:

  * finish styling
  * add datatype validation on the input and update forms - mobile number should be all ints, etc.
  * add column length checking in UserController
  * add an error output to the form - could be done with RXJS on the UserService
